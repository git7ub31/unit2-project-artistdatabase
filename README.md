### Artist Database
## Introduction
The Artist Database is a platform that allows artists to create, showcase, manage their portfolios (such as update or edit information and delete) to help keep track of it. The application enables users to upload their profiles, including their biography, work links, and more to come! It also allows other users to discover artists, like their profiles to show support, and interact by leaving comments where they can reach out or share their reviews/experiences or working with the artist. This project aims to provide a creative space for artists to connect with a larger community.
