### Artist Portfolio Database
## Introduction
The Artist Database is a portfolio platform that allows artists to create, showcase, and manage their portfolios (such as update or edit information and delete). The application enables users to upload their profiles, including their biography, work links, and more to come! It also allows other users to discover artists, like their profiles to show support, and interact by leaving comments where they can reach out or share their reviews/experiences or working with the artist. This project aims to provide a creative space for artists to connect with a larger community.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: EJS, HTML, CSS
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: User sessions for login and management
- Styling: Custom CSS, W3Schools, Bootstrap for responsive design
- _**still in the works**_ File Uploads: Multer for image upload (portfolio images)

## Upcoming Improvements & Additions
- The site will enable artists to have more control and varitey as to what they can upload and share. 
- It will also contain a "contact me" section where they can fill in a form with their requests or send a direct email.
